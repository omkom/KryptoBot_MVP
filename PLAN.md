# Solana Memecoin Sniping Bot - Development Plan (Dockerized)

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the development plan for a high-performance, production-ready Solana memecoin sniping bot designed to run within a Docker Compose environment. The bot will autonomously identify potential memecoins by monitoring liquidity pool creations, analyze them, execute buy orders rapidly, and manage sell positions based on predefined strategies. Communication between bot components will primarily utilize Redis Pub/Sub for speed and scalability within the Docker network.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js (Latest LTS)
- **Blockchain Interaction:** `@solana/web3.js`, `@solana/spl-token`
- **DEX Interaction:** Relevant SDKs (e.g., `@raydium-io/raydium-sdk`, `@orca-so/whirlpools-sdk`)
- **Inter-Service Communication:** Redis (via `ioredis` Node.js client)
- **API Server:** Express
- **Real-time Updates:** Socket.io
- **Logging:** Winston (JSON format to stdout/files), Chalk (for debug console)
- **Process Management:** Docker Compose
- **Environment Variables:** `dotenv`
- **Security:** Secrets via env vars, Docker secrets, or Vault for production

## 3. Architecture (Dockerized)

The bot consists of multiple Node.js services communicating via Redis, all orchestrated through Docker Compose:

- `redis`: Message broker.
- `lp-monitor`: Monitors Solana logs for new liquidity pools.
- `token-filter`: Validates potential tokens.
- `buy-executor`: Executes buy transactions.
- `sell-manager`: Executes sells based on TP/SL.
- `api-server` *(optional)*: Express-based UI/API + Socket.io.

**Communication Flow:**
